#####-Survey App Website:-

## Welcome to our Survey App! This project is a MERN Stack web application.

#####-Backend Server and API Development:
### A RESTful API is built using Node.js, which facilitates efficient data exchange between the frontend and the database.

#####-Data Storage and Management:

### Survey questionnaires, user responses and other essential data are stored    and managed through MongoDB.


#####-Real-time data synchronization:
## Node.js and React together are able to update real-time data through the use of WebSockets, which can directly display user responses during surveys.

#####-Client-Side User Interface:
## React creates responsive and dynamic user interfaces, which are easy and  attractive for users.

#####-Authentication and Authorization:
## The secure login system is implemented using Firebase Authentication, which protects user data and follows the OAuth protocol.

#####-User Management:
## User registration, login and profile management is easy and secure with Firebase Authentication.

#####-Asynchronous data handling:
## The asynchronous nature of Node.js helps in faster data handling and reduced response time, which improves the user experience.


#####-Advantages of No-SQL Database:
## MongoDB's document-oriented database provides flexibility and scalability in data modeling.
